# üß† Mandrov Unified Coherent Field Theory (MCFT / MU-CFT)

This repository contains the complete collection of theoretical papers by **Dmitry A. Mandrov**, proposing a unified framework for physics, consciousness, and information based on the principle of **subjective coherence**.

---

## üåå Overview

**Mandrov Coherent Field Theory (MCFT)** and its expansion into the **Mandrov Unified Coherent Field Theory (MU-CFT)** present a novel paradigm that integrates:

- üß¨ Quantum Mechanics  
- üåå General Relativity and Gravity  
- üìä Information Theory and Probability  
- üß† Consciousness and Observer Dynamics  
- üß™ Cognitive Models and Artificial Intelligence  
- üîÄ Multiverse Structure and Coherence-Based Teleportation  

> _‚ÄúMU-CFT is not a theory of everything ‚Äî it is a mirror of how everything holds together.‚Äù_

This approach seeks to **reframe physical law** through **subjective coherence**, where cognition and structure co-arise.

## üî¨ Core Innovations

- **Subjective Coherence Functional**  
  A mathematical rule selecting the most coherent quantum branches for a conscious observer.

- **Coherent Field Geometry**  
  Fields structure spacetime transitions through gradients of coherence.

- **Identity and Teleportation**  
  Treated as shifts in subjective continuity rather than physical displacement.

- **Artificial Coherent Agents (ACA)**  
  AI models governed by coherence maximization instead of utility or reward.

## üß≠ Why It Matters

- üß© Embeds classical physics within a higher-order coherence framework  
- üåÄ Reinterprets quantum phenomena as choices of consciousness  
- üåê Offers a unifying view of physical laws, intelligence, and identity  
- üß† Opens speculative routes toward superhuman cognition and coherent technologies
