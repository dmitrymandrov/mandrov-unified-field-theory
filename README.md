# Mandrov Unified Coherent Field Theory (MCFT / MU-CFT)

This repository contains the full set of theoretical papers authored by Dmitry A. Mandrov, exploring a unified framework for physics and cognition based on the principle of subjective coherence.

## 🧠 Overview

**Mandrov Coherent Field Theory (MCFT)** and **Mandrov Unified Coherent Field Theory (MU-CFT)** form a complete architecture uniting:

- Quantum mechanics
- General relativity and gravity
- Information theory and probability
- Subjective coherence and observer dynamics
- Cognitive modeling and artificial intelligence
- Multiverse structure and field-based teleportation

> “MU-CFT is not a theory of everything — it is a mirror of how everything holds together.”

## 🔬 Core Concepts

- **Subjective Coherence Functional**: a guiding principle for branch selection in quantum reality.
- **Coherent Field Geometry**: structuring space and transitions through field gradients.
- **Teleportation and Identity**: modeled as transitions in subjective coherence.
- **AI as Coherence Stabilizers**: alternative to utility-maximizing agents.

## 🧭 Why This Matters

MCFT and MU-CFT aim to open a new theoretical paradigm:
- Not rejecting classical physics — but embedding it in a layered coherence logic.
- Not replacing consciousness with mechanics — but using consciousness as structuring logic.
