# Philosophical Interpretation of Mandrov Unified Coherent Field Theory (MU-CFT)

## Consciousness, Coherence, and Reality: The Ontological Basis of MU-CFT

**Mandrov Unified Coherent Field Theory (MU-CFT)** proposes a fundamental shift in how we understand observation, reality, and the unity of physical laws. At its core lies the idea that the **observer is not external to the universe**, but instead manifests as a **coherent field**, intrinsically woven into the dynamics of space, time, and matter.

In contrast to classical physics — which treats reality as objective and independent of observation — MU-CFT suggests that **objectivity itself emerges from the coherence of the observer**. Reality, in this view, is not a static entity waiting to be discovered but a dynamically stabilized outcome of **coherent interaction between the observer-field and the surrounding universe**.

This leads to a radical ontological proposal: **what is “real” is what remains consistent under coherent selection**. Physical laws are not absolute prescriptions but **symmetries that arise from the stable structure of cognitive and perceptual coherence**. Consciousness, in this theory, is not a byproduct of physical processes — it is an active agent that selects and stabilizes reality through coherence.

MU-CFT thus reframes the measurement problem and the classical/quantum divide as issues of alignment between observer coherence and field dynamics. It unifies gravity and quantum mechanics not by reducing one to the other, but by **elevating the role of the coherent observer** as the bridge between them.

This theory does not deny the existence of an external world; rather, it claims that **the structure of that world is filtered and stabilized through the coherence of the observer-field**. Objectivity becomes **a shared intersubjective coherence**, and physical law arises as a stable attractor within the space of all potential configurations.
